            E-commerce began in the 1960s, when businesses started using EDI to
            share business documents with other companies. In 1979, the American
            National Standards Institute developed ASC X12 as a universal
            standard for businesses to share documents through electronic
            networks

            Many retail e-commerce apps use online marketing techniques to get
            customers to use the platform. These include email, online catalogs
            and shopping carts, Electronic Data Interchange, file transfer
            protocol, web services and mobile applications. These approaches are
            used in B2C and B2B activities, as well as other types of outreach.
            They include emailing targeted ads and e-newsletters to subscribers
            and sending SMS texts to mobile devices. Sending unsolicited emails
            and texts is generally considered spam. More companies now try to
            entice consumers online, using tools such as digital coupons, social
            media marketing and targeted advertisements.
